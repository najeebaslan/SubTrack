    serviceIcon = model.imageUri,
    paymentMethod = selectedPaymentMethod,
    price = model.price,
    fee = model.fee,
    total = model.total
  ))
navController.navigate("bill-payment")

// From any other screen
navController.currentBackStackEntry?.savedStateHandle?.set("billPaymentModel",
  BillPaymentModel(
    serviceName = model.name,
    serviceIcon = model.imageUri,
    paymentMethod = selectedPaymentMethod,
