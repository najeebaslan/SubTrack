## üöÄ Navigation Optimization

- **All routes** are defined in `ScreenRoutes` for type safety and easy refactoring.
- **NavigationHelper** provides simple, reusable methods for all navigation actions.
- **Data passing** is handled via NavController's `savedStateHandle` with clear keys.

**Example:**
```kotlin
// Navigate to Bill Details
NavigationHelper.navigateToBillDetails(navController, bill)

// In NavHost
composable(ScreenRoutes.BILL_DETAILS) {
  val model = remember {
    navController.previousBackStackEntry?.savedStateHandle?.get<UpcomingBillsItem>(ScreenRoutes.Keys.BILL_MODEL)
  }
  // ...
}
```

2. **Bill Details Screen**: Review bill info, select payment method, tap "Pay Now" (uses GradientButton).
3. **Bill Payment Screen**: Confirm payment details, tap "Confirm and Pay" (uses GradientButton).
4. **Payment Successfully Screen**: See confirmation and return to home.

## üì¶ Data Models

  val serviceIcon: Int,         // Drawable resource ID
  val paymentMethod: String,    // e.g., "BCA OneKlik"
  val price: String,           // e.g., "$ 11.99"
  val fee: String,             // e.g., "$ 1.99"
  val total: String            // e.g., "$13.98"
